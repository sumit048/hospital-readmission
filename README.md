# hospital-readmission
Using the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset, which contains over 70,000 patient encounters across 130 hospitals from 1999–2008, we perform end-to-end data science tasks — including data cleaning, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, model training, evaluation, and deployment through a Streamlit web app.
